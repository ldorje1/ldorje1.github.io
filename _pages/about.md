<p style="font-size: 17px;"> I am a third-year PhD student at Binghamton University. My research focuses on modelling a lightweight 5G mmWave imaging for surveillance applications. I use machine learning to develop faster and more efficient imaging techniques. I also work on addressing security challenges in these systems.
I am currently an [SFS scholar](https://sfs.opm.gov/) and a [Clifford D. Clark Fellow](https://www.binghamton.edu/grad-school/awards-honors/clark-fellowship.html). I completed an MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering and hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics. I also interned at the Air Force Research Laboratory in 2023 and 2024, focusing on cybersecurity in radio frequency imaging systems.</p>

### Research Area:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Robotics
- Reinforcement Learning
- Dialog Navigation Systems
