<p style="font-size: 17px;">
  I am a third-year PhD student at Binghamton University. My research focuses on modelling a lightweight 5G mmWave imaging for surveillance applications. I use machine learning to develop faster and more efficient imaging techniques. I also work on addressing security challenges in these systems.
  I am currently an <a href="https://sfs.opm.gov/">SFS scholar</a> and a <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/grad-school/awards-honors/clark-fellowship.html">Clifford D. Clark Fellow</a>. I completed my MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering and hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics. I also interned at the Air Force Research Laboratory in 2023 and 2024, focusing on cybersecurity in radio frequency imaging systems.
